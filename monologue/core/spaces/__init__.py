    Spaces are the main idea behind monologue. the following are important
    - schema /views
    - subscriptions
    - performance of agents
    - exchanges of memory fragments
    ***
    
    Spaces must be dynamic but some are based on known entities and processes. 
    We can manage and evolve schema and also views on data
    
    Agents are tools that provide access to spaces. The tool config is similar to the space config
    There is a language of restriction that and focus that is surface in the tool
