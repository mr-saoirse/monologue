        Trips made by New York Cityâ€™s iconic yellow taxis have been recorded and provided to the TLC
        since 2009. Yellow taxis are traditionally hailed by signaling to a driver who is on duty and seeking
        a passenger (street hail), but now they may also be hailed using an e-hail app like Curb or Arro.
        Yellow taxis are the only vehicles permitted to respond to a street hail from a passenger in all five
        boroughs.
        Records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations,
        trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
        The records were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by
        technology service providers. The trip data was not created by the TLC, and TLC cannot
        guarantee their accuracy.
