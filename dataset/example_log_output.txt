FINAL ANSWER:
The top three characters that spend the most time in a castle are Sleeping Beauty, Sindbad, and Jack.\n\nSleeping Beauty, known for spending a significant amount of time in castles, fell into a deep sleep after being pricked by an enchanted spindle. She is portrayed as a gracious lady who enchanted not only the three good fairies but also everyone around her with her beauty and grace. Sleeping Beauty has blue eyes and her closest friends are the Three Good Fairies.\n\nSindbad, the sailor, travelled the world and has been to castles multiples times during his adventures. He once found himself in a beautiful country after being carried along a river from a mountain. Sindbad is adventurous and daring, often establishing friendships with sailors and merchants on his travels. He has black eyes and his closest friends are sailors and merchants he met on his travels.\n\nJack, the main character from "Jack and the Beanstalk", has also spent time in castles. He is known for his adventurous nature, as revealed from the story where he decided to climb the beanstalk once again to take more of the ogre\'s treasures when he and his mother ran out of money. Jack is a brave and adventurous boy with a quick wit that allows him to make the best out of his situations. Jack has blue eyes, and his closest friend is his mother.
